# Sort_Manager
Project that allows sorting of a user input array of integers and through various sorting algorithms returns this sorted.

Within this project we use multiple interfaces to provide a listed set behaviour for our sorting algorithms. A factory has also been incorporated 
so that the user can decide which sorting algorithm they would like to use. 

Alongside this project tests were created in order to ensure high quality of code. 

Iterations:
1. Sorter interface created
2. Bubble Sorter added
3. Merge Sorter added
4. Quick Sorter added
5. Insertion Sorter added
6. Unit tests for sorters
7. File reader created
8. Sorter Factory created
9. Unit tests for factory created
10. Integration tests created.
